# AnomalyDetect3
This is a python3 program with a Graphic User Interface designed to automate the discovery of abnormal user behavior using isolation forest from CSV files. The intention of this is for system administraters to adjust parameters within the isolation_ai_BETA.py program to better identify abnormal use rbehavior. This allows system administraters to guard their companies and networks against malicious insiders. In the current BETA version, when a login is detected to occur outside of business hours or take a very short ammount of time to occur (or a very long ammount of time) this will flag an anomaly. 
Users who are persistently flagging anomalies are coded in bold and red inside the User Interface so system administrators can take action to deter damage by locking an account or starting an investigative audit. 
The program uses the python4 pandas, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.ensemble, tkinter, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg libraries. 
The anomalies are identified, listed, and plotted inside the UI after the user sends a CSV file for the program to analyze. A test file is included in this repo.
